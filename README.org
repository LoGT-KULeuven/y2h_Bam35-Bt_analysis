* Dataset description
The dataset analyzed here consists of two sets of files and is
described in:

[[tbd][TBD]]

DOI: TBD

All sequencing files are available via the NCBI database and were
gathered using a MiSeq machine, with a paired-end 2*300 bp approach,
based on amplicons.

* Environmnent
The pipeline relies on [[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html][snakemake]] for the automation of the analysis,
which in turns uses [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][conda]] to create the environment for each of the
specific steps in the pipeline. The other python package necessary to
get the pipeline started is [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][Pandas]].

Other softwares included in this project, separately from those
available through conda include:

- [[https://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/weesam-version-1-5/][an adapted version of weeSAM]]

* Analysis of the library
The snakefile corresponding to the analysis of the initial library of
fragments, together with the definition of the different conda
environments is available in the folder [[file:initial_library_analysis/][initial_library_analysis]]

* Analysis of the y2h positive interactions
The snakefile corresponding to the analysis of the positive
interaction results, together with the definition of
the different conda environments is available in the folder
[[file:y2h_positives_analysis/][y2h_positives_analysis]]
