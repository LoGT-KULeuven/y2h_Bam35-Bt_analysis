described in:

[[tbd][TBD]]

DOI: TBD

All sequencing files are available via the NCBI database and were
gathered using a MiSeq machine, with a paired-end 2*300 bp approach,
based on amplicons.

* Environmnent
The pipeline relies on [[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html][snakemake]] for the automation of the analysis,
which in turns uses [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][conda]] to create the environment for each of the
specific steps in the pipeline. 

Other softwares included in this project, separately from those
available through conda include:

- [[https://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/weesam-version-1-5/][an adapted version of weeSAM]]

* Analysis of the library
The snakefile corresponding to the analysis, together with the
definition of the different conda environments is available in the 
* Analysis of the y2h positive interactions
